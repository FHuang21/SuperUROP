Weekly Progress Report

9/18 - 9/22
- Performed literature review on self-supervised models as well as sleep-monitoring devices
- Watching/reading through "The Missing Semester (IAP)" Course - important tools*
- Initialized git repo; cloned pre-existing intern files

To-Dos:
- Setup CSAIL account to gain access to private data and TensorBoard
- Create own __init__.py file; write models and training loop scripts
- For dataloader (init file), focus on class EEG_Encoding_SHHS2_Dataset(Dataset):

9/25 - 9/29
Dataset: Build out __init__, len(), get() functions
Model: Build out __init__, forward() functions
Main (Running): Understand Tensorboard/Torch Metrics, Optimizer, Training Loop, Eval Loop, and Loss Function

To-Dos:
- Gain access to GPU and Models on Server
- Gain Redcap access from BWH (Hospital)
- Setup Analytics Repo
